ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about LSTMs and GANs <br/>
ðŸ¤” I hope to dive deeper into PyTorch and Theano <br/>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Deep Learning ML project focused on the shortcomings of perception modules in autonomous vehicles (i.e. TinyYolo, SSD) <br/>
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python/Java/C open source projects! <br/>
