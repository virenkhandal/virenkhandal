### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Blockchain and RNNs <br/>
ðŸ¤” I hope to dive deeper into LightGBM and Computational Proof Solvers (i.e. Ramanujan Machine, etc.) <br/>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Full Stack Web Application that leverages Blockchain to deliver meaningful content on social media! <br/>
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python/Java/Javascript open source projects! <br/>
